The initial load takes too long
* not network related as far as I can tell, so the threejs initialization is slow
* can I pre-render everything on the server?

Find a high resolution image for the globe surface, when you zoom in, it's clear that the quality is insufficient

trackball controls are not ideal, very easy for the globe to tilt, how can I configure these?

We have no location data for the Chinese pops from the API I'm using, I have to get it from a geo-mapping service somehwere
=> Can hardcode it at the start, these things don't change often.

label text color should be white
=> Will I have to generate a second globe? I don't see a way to define differnet colors for the dot and the label of the dot

Special characters are not displayed correctly (Muenchen, Zuerich etc)

Add a legend to explain the color coding

Can we make the dots clickable to retrieve more information?

Can we use Radar data to make this more interesting? https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/radar/

If there's re-routing from one PoP to another, can we show that?
=> use arcs: https://github.com/vasturiano/globe.gl?tab=readme-ov-file#arcs-layer

check that the globe also looks good on mobile
=> make it mobile friendly

Lots of javascript is being downloaded, is this all needed?

Add some basic website tracking

get a review from Claude Code

introduce hono for the API

set up HURL for API tests: https://hurl.dev

for testing of the endpoints, I need to delete the values in KV, I can make a call with wrangler to achieve this.
=> First call, you get the response from the API which is then put in cache for a period of time
=> if the second call appears before cache expiration, then you are served from cache
--> I don't want to have to wait until Cache expiration, I want to delete the value in KV

Mock the locations service from CF; build tests around them

Mock the status service from CF; build tests around them

introduce ESLint

introduce Typescript

control API schemas with Zod
-> First for the responses from the APIs we talk to
-> second for the API that we ourselves are exposing
