check that the globe also looks good on mobile

We have no location data for the Chinese pops

set up HURL for API tests: https://hurl.dev

for testing of the endpoints, I need to delete the values in KV, I can make a call with wrangler to achieve this.
=> First call, you get the response from the API which is then put in cache for a period of time
=> if the second call appears before cache expiration, then you are served from cache
--> I don't want to have to wait until Cache expiration, I want to delete the value in KV

Mock the locations service from CF; build tests around them

Mock the status service from CF; build tests around them

introduce ESLint

introduce Typescript

control API schemas with Zod
-> First for the responses from the APIs we talk to
-> second for the API that we ourselves are exposing
